# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Description
This is a command-line implementation of tic-tac-toe written to complete a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).  
The project is written entirely in Ruby and uses Rspec to run tests on its various functions.  
### Challenges
A major challenge when writing this project was prioritizing readability and conciseness. I found that I tended to overcomplicate even the simplest 
functions and even added an unnecessary Cell object at one point. However, the fact that I recognized these flaws and fixed them whenever I came back 
to the project means that I am improving as a developer and I am content with that. Progress over Perfection always
## How to Run
You could fork this [Tic-Tac-Toe Repl](https://replit.com/@bartelsjacobcor/tik-tac-toe?v=1) and run it online.  
Alternatively, you could fork this repo, clone it, and run the main.rb file with `ruby main.rb`
